# Each DV node must compute:
# - Its own DV using 1 & 2.  This will be optimal, given the info I have.
# - Whenever either 1 or 2 changes, I must recompute my DV.
# - Whenever my DV changes, send my updated DV to all neighbors.

## NEED TO FIGURE OUT

# deleting nodes, and when links get longer

# We need of the form {(src,dst):(seq,latency)}?

# link_has_been_updated gets called

# recalculate its own dv
# if it changes, send it to its neighbors

# process_incoming_routing_message gets called
# update its own neighboring distance vectors with dv just received
